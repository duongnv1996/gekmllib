= Introduction =

Welcome to the gekmllib project, a Java library designed to ease the creation and manipulation of KML for Google Earth.

This is version 0.03 of the library, it's nowhere near a complete implementation. 

= News =

Source now in SVN.

Documentation in docs dir in SVN, will make it into next Jar release.

= Details =

The classes are designed so that you can only add correct elements to each other, eg you can't add a GroundOverlay to a Placemark. There is currently no Schema validation carried out.

= Current Limitations =
No convenient constructors, all classes use empty constructor, and are then initialised using getters and setters (as per Bean spec).

There is currently no Schema validation carried out.

*Note: No longer requires Java 5*
